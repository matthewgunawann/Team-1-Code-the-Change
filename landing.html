        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Sisilain Ibukota is a compassionate non-profit organization dedicated to supporting
           the marginalized neighborhoods on the outskirts of the capital city, Jakarta, where poverty
           casts a long shadow over the lives of its residents. Our core mission is to spread hope and love
           through the distribution of donated items, care packages, and personal expressions of support. 
           We gather gently used clothes, household items, and other essentials from 
           generous donors, package them with care, and deliver them directly to those in need. 
           Each care package is not just a collection of items but a tangible symbol of community, care, and connection. 
           Sisilain Ibukota believes in the power of kindness and solidarity, aiming to ensure that no one 
           in these communities feels forgotten or alone. Our volunteers are the heart of our organization, reaching out to
           embrace all individuals with open arms and warm hearts, making a difference one care package at a time.</p>
